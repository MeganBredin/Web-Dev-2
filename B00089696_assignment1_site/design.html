	<div class="designinfo"><h4> Poster design </h4>
    <p> This is the very first progect that we got as part of of studies of Design in college. The brief was to design a poster for a spacific room that was in colleg. I got a room that was for the study of Early Childhood Education. I found it extremly enjoyable to do this project and i thought that it was a nice ice breaker for the module.</p></div>

    <p> This was an assignment that we recieved in our first semester of college. It was to design, draw and inhance a drawing of a camera. At first the job seemed imposible but then once I started, I found it to be quite relaxing and fun. The picutre here shows four out of the thirthy drawings I did.</p>
